# Objective: 
How GDP per capita and happiness ranking are hugely affected by the pandemic? Did countries with higher GDP handle pandemic better than other countries?

# Thoughts after analysis:
   1. From the Treemap it is clear that the third world countries like “Nigeria, Lebanon, Jordan, Algeria, Chile” rankings are hugely affected in 2020 and their GDP per capita also took a hit.
   2. Upon analysis deeper analysis we noticed that the ranking of certain countries decreases even when the GDP increases by a small fraction this is due to the other factors on the happiness index. However the ranking of almost all the countries increased when there is a significant increase in the GDP per capita.
   3. So, to answer the question at hand it is safe to say that almost all the top 20 ranked countries of 2019 retained their place in the top 20 list of 2020. So, it is safe to say that the countries with higher GDP managed a decent level of success even with the pandemic. Even a few countries like “Central Arican republic, madagascar” actually managed to improve their ranking this could be due to the less number of COVID-19 cases recorded in these countries.
